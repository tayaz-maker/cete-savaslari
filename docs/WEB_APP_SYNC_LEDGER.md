# Web ↔ App sync ledger

Track **meaningful** [www.tariklab.com](https://www.tariklab.com) changes that a later **standalone native game** must match.

This is a reminder list, not a second technical report.

## Binding rules

- **Active product:** www.tariklab.com. Web ships first and does **not** wait for native.
- **Native/Godot:** paused. Do not resume unless the product owner explicitly says so.
- **Download model:** each TarikLab game will be its **own** standalone downloadable title — not one giant native TarikLab app.
- **Parity:** Web ↔ Native Content Parity is binding. Log relevant web work here; apply it later on the matching native game.
- **Canonical shared content:** private [`tayaz-maker/tariklab-content`](https://github.com/tayaz-maker/tariklab-content). Web and native **bundle copies**. Do not treat generated `catalog.json` / `designs.js` as authored source.
- **Audio:** disabled.
- **Safety:** never remove existing website games, content, data, or routes because of native work. Do not change gameplay just to create parity.

## When to append

Append after a meaningful website change to a game or shared brand/content. Skip typos, comments, CI, and docs-only work unless they redefine content or presentation a native game would need.

## Entries

### 2026-09-12 — VETO-H! + portal
- Web change: Approved 300 Astra card illustrations (576×384 WebP) and prism/spectrum portal background
- Content: no (authored cards unchanged)
- Artwork: yes
- Gameplay/rules: no
- UI/presentation: yes (prism cover crop; card art `object-fit: cover`)
- Shared-content source: yes (`tayaz-maker/tariklab-content` created)
- Native follow-up: already done (`tariklab-app` tag `veto-h-native-pilot`). Native paused after this.
- Commits: web `8355384` / merge `7eec58f`; content `d6fa1d6`; app `dc610c4`

### 2026-09-13 — VETO-H! + GETT-OH! mega refinement
- Web change: Humanized TR/EN card copy (IDs/mechanics unchanged); 5 AI profiles; match action history; post-match analysis + OP graph; inspector related cards; VETO-H! campaign styles + election-night result + campaign file; GETT-OH! neighborhood identity; drag/drop with tap fallback; hover/dblclick/long-press inspector; valid-target glow; rejection copy; keyboard 1–5/Esc/Space/I/H/A; UI scale / card size / table density
- Content: yes (TR/EN display copy)
- Artwork: no
- Gameplay/rules: no (AI weights only; identities cosmetic)
- UI/presentation: yes
- Shared-content source: yes (`tariklab-content` VETO-H! authored fields + new GETT-OH! `games/gett-oh/cards.json`)
- Native follow-up: yes (paused) — later standalone titles need: humanized names/copy, AI personalities, telemetry/history, post-match analysis, card relationships, campaign styles, election-night result, campaign history, neighborhood identity, drag/drop, inspector gestures, target glow, rejection explanations, keyboard/mobile controls, UI scale, card size, table density, resolution/windowed/fullscreen
- Commits: web `509cc29` (copy) `4deb0c9` (AI/telemetry) `57edb79` (UX) `0029894` (tests/ledger); content `672bf82`; app untouched (`dc610c4`)

### 2026-09-12 — VETO-H! + GETT-OH! web design refoundation
- Web change: Shared `design.css` token contract for readable typography, spacing, card dimensions, controls, modal/inspector widths and density. Legacy chrome is loaded in a lower-priority CSS layer. VETO-H! uses cream/gold and institutional slate; GETT-OH! uses amber/tobacco/deep green.
- Setup: fixed DOM boolean handling for `aria-pressed` (previously emitted an empty attribute); selected chips now expose true/false, check marks, contrast and keyboard focus. Two-column desktop/single-column mobile setup, scrollable body, separate visible footer, focus/scroll retained on selection. Existing saved profile/campaign/neighborhood values feed the match; live AI uses the captured match profile. Cosmetic campaign/neighborhood identities remain cosmetic and are shown beside the hand.
- Inspector/history/settings: one card-name title, larger art and natural text wrapping; internally scrolling detail and mobile sheet; turn-grouped public flow with actor distinction, collapsible desktop rail/mobile dialog; labeled scale/card/density controls and display reset. Typed localized-text and numeric-stat fallbacks avoid rendering missing values as objects/null/undefined.
- Responsive: 1440/1280/1024/768/390 widths; table, hand and commands occupy separate rows so controls never cover the hand. Constrained screens scroll the table internally instead of shrinking body typography. UI scale 80/90/100/110/125 keeps text floors; card size and density persist.
- Content: yes (AI profile and cosmetic campaign/neighborhood TR/EN descriptions only; no card copy changed)
- Artwork: no
- Gameplay/rules: no (AI weights, engine, telemetry model, post-match calculations and save schema unchanged)
- UI/presentation: yes
- Shared-content source: no (no authored card/art source changes)
- Native follow-up: yes, later standalone parity for this token system, setup semantics, modal/footer, inspector, history, settings and responsive layout. Native/Godot remains paused; `tariklab-app` untouched.
- Commits: `astra/web-duel-design-refoundation` (this entry ships with the implementation commit).
